# IntentSeal Verification Kernel — Frozen Prototype Lineage

**Frozen prototype lineage:** v0.1.1 → v0.2.0 → v0.3.0 → v0.4.0 → v0.5.0  
**Freeze date:** 2026-09-28  
**Author:** Prince Upadhyay, Independent Research

**IntentSeal** is the public name of the research prototype previously developed under the working title **AgentOS Verification Kernel**. The five historical release ZIPs are preserved byte-for-byte under their original filenames so their provenance and hashes remain intact.

IntentSeal explores a narrow security question: how to let an untrusted or prompt-injected agent propose privileged tool actions while keeping authorization, budget, review, provenance attestation, and audit enforcement outside the agent's claimed identity.

It is a research prototype, not a production security boundary.

## Frozen lineage

| Historical release | Fresh Linux verification | Main milestone |
|---|---:|---|
| v0.1.1 | 10/10 | atomic policy/budget enforcement and keyed audit chain |
| v0.2.0 | 14/14 | authenticated loopback service |
| v0.3.0 | 34/34 | review workflow, audited rejection paths, timeout/schema hardening |
| v0.4.0 | 47/47 | agent identity separated from trusted provenance by exact attestation |
| v0.5.0 | 61/61 | usable consent lifecycle, trusted-side request IDs, scoped attesters, audited timing, rate limiting, restart fault tests |

The archived source/package names inside the historical releases still use `AgentOS` / `agentos_kernel`. They are intentionally unchanged.

## Freeze rule

The five historical release ZIPs are immutable. Corrections after this archive must be additive or receive a new semantic version. Renaming the public archive to IntentSeal does not rewrite the historical release bytes.

## License and DOI status

The outer archive LICENSE states All Rights Reserved. The historical inner ZIPs retain their own original provenance and are unchanged.

The earlier 148371-byte pre-publication outer archive was superseded; its hash is retained in historical records only.

## DOI status

The frozen lineage is published as Zenodo software under the title:

**IntentSeal Verification Kernel: Frozen Prototype Lineage v0.1.1–v0.5.0**

DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.23016445](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23016445)  
Record: https://zenodo.org/records/23016445

This DOI applies only to the frozen v0.1.1–v0.5.0 Verification Kernel lineage. It does not identify the separate Verifiable Research Kernel (VRK).
